Currency Converter using Python (Tkinter GUI)
This project is a desktop GUI application built using Python and Tkinter that allows users to convert currency amounts from one type to another using static exchange rates.

Key Features:
- User-friendly graphical interface
- Input field to enter the amount
- Dropdown menus to choose 'From' and 'To' currencies
- Visual arrow between currency selectors to indicate conversion direction
- Responsive design that adjusts to screen size (mobile/tablet/laptop)
- Displays conversion result clearly below the Convert button

User Interface Details:
- The main window features a title "Currency Converter" and a heading "Enter the amount"
- Below the input field, currency dropdowns are aligned side by side with a directional arrow (â†’) in between
- A Convert button performs the conversion when clicked
- The result is displayed just below the button in a bold font

Technical Implementation:
- Static exchange rates are stored in a dictionary (e.g., USD, INR, EUR, JPY, GBP)
- The app converts the amount to USD as an intermediate step, then to the target currency
- Tkinter widgets like Label, Entry, Button, and ttk.Combobox are used
- Basic styling is applied using font size, background colors, and layout options
- Screen width is detected using winfo_screenwidth() to adjust font sizes and widget dimensions accordingly

This project demonstrates GUI design, layout management, input handling, and basic currency conversion logic in Python.
